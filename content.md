# Find the "Kth" Largest Element in an Array üîç

## The problem
Write a function that:
- Takes an unsorted array of integers (array) and an integer (k).
- Finds the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
- Returns the kth largest element.

## Understand the Problem
Before we dive into the solution, let's ensure we understand the task with a simple exercise.

- Consider the array `[3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]` and `k = 2`. What is the 2nd largest element in this array?
- (3, 2)
  - Incorrect. This answer does not represent a single element, and neither of these numbers is the 2nd largest element in the array.
- 5
  - Correct! When the array is considered in sorted order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the 2nd largest element is indeed 5.
- 4
  - Incorrect. While 4 is an element in the array, it is not the 2nd largest element when the array is sorted.

This exercise helps to illustrate the concept of sorting and finding elements by their order in an array. Keep this understanding as we proceed to solve the main problem.

## Think Aloud
Express your thought process out loud. Begin with a brute force method, like sorting the array and finding the kth largest element by index. Discuss the efficiency of this approach and how it might be improved, perhaps with a heap or priority queue for better time complexity.

## Test your code

```ruby
arrays = [
  [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4],
  [3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
]
ks = [2, 4, 5]
array = arrays.sample
k = ks.sample
# write your function here
def find_kth_largest(array, k)

end

puts find_kth_largest(array, k)

## Tips and Clues for Solving the Problem
- **Sorting**: A simple approach is to sort the array in descending order and pick the kth element. This is intuitive but may not be the most efficient in terms of time complexity.
- **Heap**: A more sophisticated and efficient method involves using a priority queue or heap to keep track of the largest elements seen so far. Try initializing a heap (sorted array) of the first k elements in the array, then iterate through the remaining elements, adding any elements that are larger than the smallest in the heap.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider what happens if k is larger than the array size or if the array contains duplicates. How will your solution handle these cases?

## Quiz
- What is the time complexity of finding the kth largest element using sorting?
- O(n log n) due to the time complexity of sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.
  - Correct! Sorting the array is a common approach, and most efficient sorting algorithms have a time complexity of O(n log n).
- O(n) if using a linear time selection algorithm or a properly implemented priority queue.
  - Correct, but with a nuance. While the average case for some selection algorithms or a heap can approach O(n), this is highly dependent on the implementation and the nature of the data.
- O(n^2) as it requires checking each element against every other element.
  - Incorrect. While some naive sorting algorithms have O(n^2) complexity, more efficient algorithms are typically used for this problem.

- Which data structure can optimize the process of finding the kth largest element?
- Array, when sorted.
  - Correct, but more efficient methods exist. Sorting the array does allow for finding the kth largest element, but sorting first might not be the most efficient approach.
- Priority Queue (Heap).
  - Correct! A priority queue or heap is especially useful for efficiently finding the kth largest element without needing to sort the entire array.
- Linked List.
  - Incorrect. While you can find the kth largest element by traversing a linked list, this method lacks the efficiency and benefits provided by a priority queue or sorting.

- How does a heap help in finding the kth largest element?
- By allowing linear search through all elements.
  - Incorrect. Heaps do not facilitate linear search through elements; they structure data in a way that allows for efficient extraction of the maximum or minimum element.
- By organizing elements so that the kth largest can be found without sorting the entire array.
  - Correct! A heap, particularly a min-heap or max-heap, can be used to maintain a subset of the largest elements, allowing for efficient extraction of the kth largest element.
- By encrypting the array elements for secure comparison.
  - Incorrect. Heaps do not involve encryption; they are a data structure that organizes elements to allow for efficient access to the largest or smallest values.
